                    <p class="experience-description">As a marketing agency with 1,000+ clients and dozens of services, Pronto faced challenges scaling to the next level with our business data spread across multiple systems and SaSS services. This project started with building a Customer Portal with integrations to our billing system (Zuora), CRM (Pipedrive), support system (Zendesk), and a custom onboarding system with a dynamic form wizard. We also integrated with our website development platform, WordPress Multisite, to bring core customer data together into the same application and facilitate automated sync across systems. <a href="https://www.prontomarketing.com/2014/10/everything-pronto-all-in-one-place/" target="_blank">Read the Announcement</a></p>
                    <p class="experience-description">From there we entered new territory focusing on our customers with marketing performance dashboards for Website Traffic, Web Leads, Keyword Tracking, Competitor Tracking, and Monthly Performance Reports. This involved a whole new set of integrations to Google Analytics, Moz, and Authority Labs Partner API. <a href="https://www.prontomarketing.com/2015/02/launched-the-ultimate-marketing-dashboard-for-your-small-business/" target="_blank">Read the Announcement</a></p>

                    <p class="experience-description">Pronto needed a website platform to build and maintain 1,000s of unique websites for their customers to scale. Key goals for this project included mobile friendliness (responsive), ease of site development, maintainability, flexibility, and performance. The platform now has more than 700 websites, page load times of < 2s, 99.996% uptime on less than $1,000/m infrastructure costs. We used top tier technologies such as Varnish, Nginx, HHVM, Memcached deployed on AWS using Route 53, Ec2, Elasticache, and RDS. <a href="https://www.prontomarketing.com/2014/01/phoenix-lets-business-websites-soar-to-new-heights/" target="_blank">Read the Annoucement</a> / <a href="https://www.prontomarketing.com/showcase/" target="_blank">View Showcase</a></p>
